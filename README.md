# Kron Cohort 77 Differential Expression Analysis

This repository contains all code used for the  analysis of gene differential expression results *Aplysia californica* sensory neurons and orthology of genes in *Aplysia californica* to those of humans with special focus on genes of interest for Alzheimer's Disease. This analysis was performed in the lab of Dr. Lynne Fieber at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.  This repository consists mainly of the R project hierarchy and associated files and scripts used  during this analysis.
